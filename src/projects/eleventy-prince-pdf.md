Using Prince, you can generate accessible, tagged PDFs from HTML and CSS. I created a demo site and a plugin to make this easier for people using Eleventy.

I also talked about this topic on [a stream of Some Antics with Ben Myers](https://someantics.dev/create-accessible-pdfs-with-eleventy-and-prince/).

Demo site: [Accessible document workflow with Eleventy and Prince](https://11ty-prince-pdf-example.netlify.app/)

Eleventy plugin: [eleventy-plugin-prince-pdf](https://github.com/larryhudson/eleventy-plugin-prince-pdf)
