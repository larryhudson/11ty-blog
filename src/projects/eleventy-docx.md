If you stick to a simple structure and use Word's paragraph styles, you can convert Word documents to HTML while keeping the semantics intact.

I created a plugin that makes it easy to use Microsoft Word documents as Eleventy input.

Eleventy plugin: [eleventy-plugin-docx](https://github.com/larryhudson/eleventy-plugin-docx)
