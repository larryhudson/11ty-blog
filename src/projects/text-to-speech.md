Using [Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services Speech API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/), I created a demo site and Eleventy plugin for turning text content into high quality audio versions.

Demo site: [11ty-text-to-mp3](https://11ty-text-to-mp3.netlify.app/)

Eleventy plugin: [eleventy-plugin-text-to-speech](https://11ty-text-to-mp3.netlify.app/)
