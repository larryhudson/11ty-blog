Hi there! Welcome to my personal site.

I'm a web developer and programmer based in Melbourne, Australia. I'm the Team Leader of Innovation, Tech and Web at the [Information Access Group](https://www.informationaccessgroup.com/).

I'm passionate about:

- making information more accessible by offering it in different formats
- creating tools to automate repetitive tasks, so creative people can focus on being creative
- sharing knowledge and encouraging a positive team culture.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/larryhudsondev), hang out with me in the [lunch.dev Discord](https://events.lunch.dev/) and [Eleventy Discord](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/discord), or email me at [larryhudson@hey.com](mailto:larryhudson@hey.com).

## Recent experiments

I enjoy testing out ideas by creating small demos and experiments. You can see some recent experiments below.

You can [find more on my GitHub profile](https://github.com/larryhudson/).

### Generating audio versions from Eleventy content

Using [Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services Speech API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/), I created a demo site and Eleventy plugin for turning text content into high quality audio versions.

Demo site: [11ty-text-to-mp3](https://11ty-text-to-mp3.netlify.app/)

Eleventy plugin: [eleventy-plugin-text-to-speech](https://11ty-text-to-mp3.netlify.app/)

### Generating tagged PDFs from Eleventy content

Using Prince, you can generate accessible, tagged PDFs from HTML and CSS. I created a demo site and a plugin to make this easier for people using Eleventy.

I also talked about this topic on [a stream of Some Antics with Ben Myers](https://someantics.dev/create-accessible-pdfs-with-eleventy-and-prince/).

Demo site: [Accessible document workflow with Eleventy and Prince](https://11ty-prince-pdf-example.netlify.app/)

Eleventy plugin: [eleventy-plugin-prince-pdf](https://github.com/larryhudson/eleventy-plugin-prince-pdf)

### Using Notion as a CMS for your Eleventy site

I've been working on a way to use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) as a content management system for an Eleventy site.

This is a work in progress, but you can [explore the GitHub repo](https://github.com/larryhudson/eleventy-plugin-notion-data) if you're interested.

### Using Microsoft Word documents as content in your Eleventy site

If you stick to a simple structure and use Word's paragraph styles, you can convert Word documents to HTML while keeping the semantics intact.

I created a plugin that makes it easy to use Microsoft Word documents as Eleventy input.

Eleventy plugin: [eleventy-plugin-docx](https://github.com/larryhudson/eleventy-plugin-docx)
